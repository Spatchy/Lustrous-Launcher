_Lustrous Launcher was designed to be as easy to use as possible but in case you needed help with something, this tutorial exists. If you have any feedback or suggestions on how Lustrous Launcher could be improved, don't hesitate to make a post over on the [Lustrous Luncher Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/lustrouslauncher/)_

# Getting Started
_here's how to get started using Lustrous Launcher for the first time_
1. Download Lustrous Launcher from [The Realeases Page](https://github.com/Spatchy/Lustrous-Launcher/releases/latest) (the portable EXE is recommended, only download the Python source code if you know what you're doing!)
2. Move the .zip out of your downloads folder and into a more suitable location (where you move it to is up to you)
3. Unzip the file (right click -> extract all)
4. You should now have a folder named `Lustrous Launcher v1.X` where X is a number denoting the version you have (note: this folder may be inside another folder with the same name as the .zip you extracted)
##### For the EXE version:
5. Inside that folder you should run the file called `main.exe` (or just `main` if you don't have show extensions enabled in windows)
6. It is likely you will see an error `Could not install required font. Try running Lustrous Launcher with admin privillages` Don't worry, this is normal
7. Right click on `main.exe` and select `run as administrator` select `yes` at the UAC prompt
8. You should recieve a confirmation message `Inintial setup is complete. Please run Lustrous Launcher again`
9. You should now run `main.exe` again normally (you do NOT have to run it as administrator anymore)
##### For the Python version (EXE users should skip this!):
5. As with the EXE version, the `main.pyw` must be run as administrator
6. Open an elevated command prompt window (search for cmd then right click -> run as administrator)
7. In the CMD window, CD into the directory where `main.pyw` is contained.
8. type `python main.pyw` and press enter (this assumes python has been added to your windows environment variables)
9. You should recieve a confirmation message `Inintial setup is complete. Please run Lustrous Launcher again`
10. Lustrous Launcher can now be run normally
